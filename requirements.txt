# Notes:
# - Removed duplicate entries.
# - Kept specific versions if they were critical, otherwise allowed latest compatible.
# - `markdown` and `bleach` are often included by Flask or other libraries;
#   can be added back if direct use or specific versions are needed.
# - `google-generativeai[tool-utils]` implies the base `google-generativeai` is also installed.
#   Consolidated to just `google-generativeai` for simplicity unless tool-utils are explicitly used
#   in a way that requires the extra. The core SDK should be sufficient for the `genai.Client` usage seen.
